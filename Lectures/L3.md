# Prolog (cont)

## Input / Output

**Output**:
- *write/1* - writes a term
- *put_char/1* - prints a single character
- *put_code/1* - prints a single character given its ASCII code
- *put_byte/1* - write binary data 
- peek_char, peek_code and peek_byte obtain a single character /
code / byte without consuming it from the input stream

**Input**:
- *read/1* - reads a term
- *get_char* - obtains a single character
- *get_code* - obtains the ASCII code of a single character
- *get_byte* - read binary data  

## File Input / Output

- *see/1* opens a file for reading
- *seen/0* closes the file that was opened for reading
- *tell/1* opens a file for writing
- *told/0* closes the file that was opened for writing

## Findall

Findall finds all solutions, including repetitions if present.
- We can use a conjunctive goal (parentheses are required)
- We can obtain more than one variable using a compound term (X-Y)
- If it fails it returns an empty string

## Bagof

Bagof is very similar to findall, althogh:

- Results are grouped by variables appearing in Goal but not in the search Term
- Fails if there are no results, while findall returns an empty list

It is possible to ignore additional variables in Goal by using existential quantifiers: **Var^Goal**.

## Setof

Setof is similar to bagof, but results are ordered and without dups.
