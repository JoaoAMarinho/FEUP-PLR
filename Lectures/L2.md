## Tracing

- Trace mode allows us to follow the computations step by step
- In the code can be activated by calling trace and desactivated with notrace

## Lists

- Empty list represented as []
- Lists elements can be anything, including other lists (ex. [ 2, [a, b, c], [3, [x, y], 4], 5 ])
- [1, 2, 3] = .(1, .(2, .(3, []) ) )
- Strings are a representation of lists of character ASCII codes

### Functions

- **length(?List, ?Size)** (Returns the length of a function)
- **member(?Elem, ?List)** (Yes for every member in list)
- **memberchk(?Elem, ?List)** (Yes only once)
- **append(?L1, ?L2, ?L3)** (Appends two lists into a third)
- **sort(+List, -SortedList)** (Sort a instanciated list)
- **keysort(+PairList, -SortedList)** (Sorts a key-value pair list, maintaining original order in same key)
