# Enumeration Predicates

## Search

Predicates to perform search:
- indomain(?X)
  - Assigns, via backtracking, admissible values to X, in increasing order
- labeling(:Options, +Variables)
- solve(:Options, :Searches)

## Search Options

The Options argument of labeling/2 controls several parameters of the search.

### Variable Choice (Ordering)

- **leftmost** (default option): leftmost variable from the variable list
- **min, max**
- **ff**: first-fail principle - variable with the smallest domain (fewer possible values)
- **ffc**: variable with the smallest domain, breaking ties by choosing the one with more suspended constraints

### Value Choice

- **step** (default option): binary choice between X #= B and X #\= B, where B is the lower or upper bound of the domain of X
- **bisect**: binary choice between X #=< M and X #> M, where M is the middle point of the domain of X (mean between the minimum and maximum values of the domain of X, rounded down)

### Value Ordering

In which order should the next value for the current variable be selected?

- **up** (default value): the domain is explored in ascending order
- **down**: the domain is explored in descending order

### Solution to find

- **satisfy** (default value): all solutions are enumerated by backtracking
- **minimize(X) / maximize(X)**

### Search Time Limit

The time_out(Time, Flag) flag defines a time limit for the search.

## Solve

- solve(:Options, :Searches)
- Options is a list of search options (similar to the ones used in labeling/2)
- Searches is a list of one or more labeling/2 or indomain/1 goals

Used primarily in optimization problems, allowing the definition of different search heuristics for distinct variables. Therefore, being useful in trying to minimize the costs or study the cost evolution.

## Optimization

```prolog
minimize(:Goal, ?X) / minimize(:Goal, ?X, +Options)
<=> (same as)
labeling([minimize(X)], [...])
```

# Statistics Predicates

- **fd_statistics(?Key, ?Value)**
- **fd_statistics/0** shows a summary of the statistics above (values since the last call to the predicate)
- **statistics(?Keyword, ?List)** for each possible key Keyword, List is unified with the current value of a counter
- **statistics/0** shows a summary of statistics related to execution time, memory, garbage collection
